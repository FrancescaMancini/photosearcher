```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(wordcloud)

get_kw <- function(x) {
  x %>% str_split(",") %>%

# Flickr papers

To understand how Flickr is currently being use in scientific research we investigated the discipline and scope of articles with the keyword `flickr` in the [PLoS journals](https://www.plos.org/).

```{r}
plos <- rplos::searchplos(q='flickr', 
                          fl=c('id','publication_date','subject', 'subject_level_1'),
                          limit = 200)$data %>% 
  
  mutate(keywords = map_chr(subject, get_kw),
         subjects = subject_level_1)
```

There are a total of `r nrow(plos)` papers with the keyword `flickr` in the PLoS journals. 

# Subject frequency

To understand which disciplines of science are using Flickr we calculated the frequency of papers in each research field:

```{r}
plos %>% 
  pull(subjects) %>% 
  paste(collapse = ",") %>% 
  str_split(",") %>% 
  table %>% 
  as_tibble()
```


# Keyword Wordcloud

To understand what topics are covered by Flickr researches we found the frequency of other keywords attributed to Flickr papers:

```{r}
kws <- plos %>% pull(keywords) %>% paste(collapse = ",") %>% str_split(",") %>% table %>% as.data.frame



wordcloud(words = kws$., freq = kws$Freq, min.freq = 1,
          max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35, 
          colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))

```
