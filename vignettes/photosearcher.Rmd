This vignette provides an overview of the functions in R package `photosearcher`.

## Searching for photographs
These are a few basic examples of the main `photo_search()` function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Search for photos of foxes in the UK for the year 2017
foxes <- photo_search(mindate = "2017-01-01",
                      maxdate = "2018-01-01",
                      text = "foxes",
                      bbox = "-12.875977,49.210420,2.636719,59.977005",
                      has_geo = TRUE)  

#Search for images of trees globally for the 1st of January 2019
trees <- photo_search(mindate = "2019-01-01",
                      maxdate = "2019-01-01",
                      text = "tree",
                      has_geo = TRUE)

#Search for images with text mountain and tagged lake
moutain_lake <- photo_search(mindate = "2019-01-01",
                             maxdate = "2019-01-01",
                             text = "mountain",
                             tags = "lake"
                             has_geo = FALSE)
```

When `has_geo == TRUE` only metadata about images with latitude and longitude information will be retrieved. 

Here, the images of UK foxes are plotted using `ggplot2`.

## Downloading images
The package can also download the images based of of their unique id number. You can direct the download to any save directory, if it doesnt exists it will be automatically created.
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Downloading fox images from photosearch
download_images(photo_id = foxes$id, saveDir = "Fox images")

#Download a specific images based off its id
download_images(photo_id = 47416147181)
```
The package will only download images that the owner on Flickr has granted download permission. Those without permission will not be downloaded, but will produce a warning to let know the ID numbers of those skipped. Permission to download does not automatically provide permission to use and distribute, check the photographs licence before use. The `photo_search` function provides the licence information for each image.

## Finding information on a user
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Find a users hometown
user <- user_info(user_id = "22299651@N07")

user$hometown
```

## Get the top tags for a location
```{r eval=FALSE}
#Find the tags for Southampton, UK
southampton <- location_tags(woe_id = 35356)

#Find the tags for New York state, US
new_york <- location_tags(woe_id = 	2347591)
```
The woe_id arguement is a FLickr specific place identifier. A places woeID can be found using the `find_place` function or using [online tools](http://woeid.rosselliot.co.nz/). 

## Find a locations woeID
```{r eval=FALSE}
  #Find woeID for Kuala Lumpur
  kuala_lumpur <- find_place(place = "Kuala Lumpur")

  kuala_lumpaur$woeid
```

## Finding tags most associated with another tag
```{r eval=FALSE}
  #Find tags associated with zebra
  zebra <- related_terms(term = "zebra")

  #Find tags most assoicated with hiking
  hiking <- related_terms(term = "hiking")
  
  #Find tags most associated with the word church
  church <- related_terms(term = "church")

```
