# How to contribute

Thank you for reading the contribution guidelines. The Flickr API has a whole range of methods currently not included here and we welcome any volunteer developers who wish to help increase the number of these included as functions in this package.
For a full list of the methods available through the Flickr API check out the [Flickr API website]( https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).

## Submitting changes

When sending a [GitHub Pull Request]( https://github.com/nfox29/photosearcher/pull/new/master
) stating clearly what you have changes you have made. For small changes single lines  messages are suffice, but for larger changes please provide a longer detailed message. 

## Coding conventions

We have a few simple coding conventions to follow:
* The package is designed following the [rOpenSci Guidelines]( http://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html). 
* Code style should be automated using the [styler package](https://github.com/r-lib/styler).
* As the package is open source, please ensure your code is clear to read for other. Where possible comment your code throughout.

Thank you,
Nathan
