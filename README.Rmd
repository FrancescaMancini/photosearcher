# photosearcher

The goal of photosearcher is to provide a repeatable methodology for accessing the Flickr API. More information can be found on the [package website](https://nfox29.github.io/photosearcher/). For more information and examples of the functions check out the [package vignette](https://nfox29.github.io/photosearcher/articles/photosearcher.html).

## Terms of use

This package should be used within accordance of the [Flickr API terms of use](https://www.flickr.com/help/terms/api).

## Installation

You can install the released version of photosearcher from github with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("nfox29/photosearcher")
```

## Getting an API key

The package requires a valid API key from the [Flickr development page](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/). The first time you call a function from the package, you will be prompted to create and enter your API key. The API key will then be saved as a .txt file and be called when using any other function.

## Package functions

The package currently focuses on the ability to use the Flickr API to search for images and their metadata through the flickr.photos.search method. The package does however support a number of other Flickr API call methods including the flickr.tags.getRelated and flickr.places.tagsForPlace methods. The Flickr website offers full [API Documentation](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) for all of its call methods.

## Searching for photo metadata

In this example, we demonstrate how to search for metadata on all images labelled with the text or keywords *rock climbing* between 2010 and 2019 in the UK and Ireland. 

```{r}
library(photosearcher)

rock_climbing <- photo_search(
  mindate = "2010-01-01",
  maxdate = "2018-01-01",
  text = "rock climbing",
  bbox = "-12.875977,49.210420,2.636719,59.977005",
  has_geo = TRUE
)  
```

When `has_geo == TRUE` only metadata about images with latitude and longitude information will be retrieved. 

These can be plotted using other packages at user preference. In the below example, we convert these to an `sf` object and plot using `ggplot2`. 

```{r}
library(sf)
rock_climbing <- st_as_sf(rock_climbing, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"))

library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = map_data("world", region = c("Ireland", "UK")), 
                               aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group),
                               fill = "lightgrey") + 
  geom_sf(data = rock_climbing) + 
  theme_bw()
```


## Issues and bugs

This package requires an internet connection as well as a connection to the Flickr API, which may not be constantly available. 

If you discover a bug not associated with connection to the API that is not already a [reported issue](https://github.com/nfox29/photosearcher/issues), please [open a new issue](https://github.com/nfox29/photosearcher/issues/new) providing a reproducible example.
